"""Per-drive driving conditions: headwind, air density and a weather summary.

Pure Python (stdlib only, no Home Assistant imports). Everything here is
derived from a drive's GPS route plus its weather samples (live Open-Meteo
``current`` samples taken by the tracker, or archive hours from the weather
backfill). A weather sample is a dict with any of ``timestamp`` (ISO-8601) or
``t`` (POSIX seconds), ``temp_f``, ``wind_speed_mph``, ``wind_dir_deg`` (the
direction the wind blows *from*), ``pressure_hpa``, ``precip_mm`` and
``humidity_pct``; a sample missing a field simply doesn't contribute to it.
