utc [s]: Current UTC timestamp (epoch) in seconds (note, not milliseconds!)

soc [SoC %]: State of Charge of the vehicle (what's displayed on the dashboard of the vehicle is preferred)
    "energy_storage/charger/adjusted_soc"

power [kW]: Instantaneous power output/input to the vehicle. Power output is positive, power input is negative (charging)
    kW = "energy_storage/main/current" * "energy_storage/main/voltage" / -1000

speed [km/h]: Vehicle speed
    "dynamics/propulsion_status/vehicle_speed_VDM"

lat [°]: Current vehicle latitude
    "telematics/gnss/position"->"lat"

lon [°]: Current vehicle longitude
    "telematics/gnss/position"->"lon"

is_charging [bool or 1/0]: Determines vehicle state. 0 is not charging, 1 is charging
    "energy_storage/charger/vehicle_charger_state" ? "charging_ready" : "charging_active"

is_dcfc [bool or 1/0]: If is_charging, indicate if this is DC fast charging
    ???

is_parked [bool or 1/0]: If the vehicle gear is in P (or the driver has left the car)
    "dynamics/propulsion_status/PRNDL" == "park"

capacity [kWh]: Estimated usable battery capacity (can be given together with soh, but usually not)
    ???

kwh_charged [kWh]: Measured energy input while charging. Typically a cumulative total, but also supports individual sessions.
soh [%]: State of Health of the battery. 100 = no degradation
    "energy_storage/SOH/rp_SOH_Q_pack"

heading [°]: Current heading of the vehicle. This will take priority over phone heading, so don't include if not accurate.
    "telematics/gnss/bearing"

elevation [m]: Vehicle's current elevation. If not given, will be looked up from location (but may miss 3D structures)
    "telematics/gnss/altitude"

ext_temp [°C]: Outside temperature measured by the vehicle
    ???

batt_temp [°C]: Battery temperature
    ???

voltage [V]: Battery pack voltage
    "energy_storage/main/voltage"

current [A]: Battery pack current (similar to power: output is positive, input (charging) is negative.)
    "energy_storage/main/current"

odometer [km]: Current odometer reading in km.
    "dynamics/odometer/value" / 1000

est_battery_range [km]: Estimated remaining range of the vehicle (according to the vehicle)
    "energy_storage/vehicle_energy/vehicle_range"
