An unofficial Rivian integration for Home Assistant, installed through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).

To use this extension, you'll need the following information

- Rivian Username
- Rivian Password
- Rivian Account's MFA/OTP Device (optional, depending on your Rivian account settings)

Your vehicle must be in delivered status and possession for this integration to function.

# Disclaimer

This [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration is not affiliated, associated, nor sponsored by Rivian Automotive, Inc.

Any use of this integration is at the sole discretion and risk of the Rivian vehicle owner integrating it into their Home Assistant installation. This owner takes full responsibility for protecting their local Home Assistant installation.

This integration is provided out of love and passion towards the Rivian ownership community. It focuses on building insights and awareness into the state of one's vehicle for use by the owner and the owner alone.

This integration will not share user or vehicle data outside Home Assistant, a single-user environment hosted and running within an owner's private network and hardware systems.

## Installation

1. Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download). In HACS add a custom repository by going to `HACS > Integrations > 3 dots > custom repositories` and adding this github repo `https://github.com/bretterer/home-assistant-rivian`. Now skip to 7.
2. If no HACS, use the tool of choice to open the directory (folder) for your Home Assistant configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
3. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
4. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `rivian`.
5. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/rivian/` directory (folder) in this repository.
6. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
7. Restart Home Assistant.
8. [![Add Integration][add-integration-badge]][add-integration] or in the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Rivian (Unofficial)".

## Configuration

To connect your newly installed integration to pull available sensor data (see the below example) for your Rivian vehicle, you should follow the following configuration recommendations. Not doing so could put your main Rivian account at risk of being locked and available.

* One Time Password (**recommended**) - It is best security practice always to enable One Time Password / Multi-Factor Authentication. This way, your credentials (username + password) can not be used without your explicit consent through the personal device configured on your Rivian account.
* No Account Reuse* (**recommended**) - Another best security practice is not to reuse accounts or credentials across different integrations (e.g., sharing credentials between Home Assistant and your everyday account). We highly recommend the owner *invite a new driver*, for example, `user+<purpose>@domain.com`, and use only this profile for configuration within Home Assistant. **Note:** Sensors will not be displayed for this new driver until the driver is signed in to a Rivian phone app and linked to the vehicle like an actual new driver. You may temporarily sign out of your Rivian phone app to set up this driver profile: Profile icon (bottom nav bar) > "Manage account" > Sign out (top right corner).

The configuration flow is as follows:

1. **Username and Password (required)**
   - For the integration to work, we require a username and password to a Rivian account with an active _driver profile_ for the vehicle you wish to monitor remotely.
2. **OTP/MFA (optional)**
   - If OTP is enabled on the account provided, you will receive a text from Rivian with a one-time use passcode entered at this step.

\*Developers and Maintainers of this project take no personal responsibility for misconfiguration or misuse of the code provided by this integration. Account security is entirely the sole responsibility of the owner configuring this integration. Accounts may become locked/quarantined due to this unofficial integration.

## Remote Vehicle Control

In addition to viewing vehicle data, it is also possible to issue certain vehicle commands remotely via Home Assistant as you would in the Rivian mobile app.

To enable this feature, you need to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your Rivian account and have an available slot for a phone key (currently limited to 4 per vehicle as of vehicle software 2023.26.00) and then configure the integration and select the vehicle(s) you want to enroll. Additionally, as of vehicle software 2023.34.00, your Home Assistant instance also needs Bluetooth (or a Bluetooth proxy device) to complete the in-vehicle pairing setup and will need to be within reach of the vehicle's bluetooth radio.

To complete the pairing setup after enabling vehicle controls in Home Assistant:

1. From within your vehicle, navigate to "Drivers and Keys" under settings
2. Select "Set Up" for the relevant phone key (this should be the name of your Home Assistant instance's home location, typically "Home")
3. Click on the "Pair" button entity for the associated vehicle in Home Assistant  
   Home Assistant will then attempt to connect to your vehicle and complete the pairing process. On Darwin (MacOS) based systems, a pop-up will appear which you will have to manually click to allow pairing. On Linux or Windows systems, this should happen automatically.
